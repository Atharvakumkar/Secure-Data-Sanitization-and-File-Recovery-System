---

# 📌 Problem Statement

### Design and Development of an Integrated Secure Data Erasure and Advanced File Recovery Tool for Digital Forensics and Data Sanitization.

The objective of this project is to build a unified platform that combines:

- Secure data sanitization
- File and folder deletion
- Disk-image sanitization
- Filesystem analysis
- Deleted-file recovery
- Raw file carving
- Fragmented-file reconstruction
- Recovery validation
- Recovery confidence scoring
- Recoverability scoring
- Before/after sanitization comparison
- Sanitization verification
- Tamper-evident audit logging
- Automated forensic reporting
- Sanitization certificate generation

The prototype is designed as a focused **2–3 day MVP** using controlled test disk images.

---

# 🎯 Core Project Objective

The main idea of the project is:

> **Don't just erase data. Prove what was recoverable before sanitization — and prove what remains afterward.**

Instead of simply performing data deletion, the system creates a closed forensic loop:

```text
RECOVER
   ↓
MEASURE
   ↓
BASELINE
   ↓
SANITIZE
   ↓
RECOVER AGAIN
   ↓
COMPARE
   ↓
VERIFY
   ↓
REPORT
```

This makes the system capable of demonstrating the effectiveness of sanitization using measurable recovery evidence.

# 👥 Team Structure

The project is divided into three major teams:

| Team | Module | Primary Responsibility |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Team 1 | Data Sanitization & File Sanitization | Securely remove data |
| Team 2 | File Recovery | Find, recover, reconstruct and validate files |
| Team 3 | Algorithm / Forensic Intelligence & Verification | Score, compare, verify, audit and report |

Each team develops its own module while following common:

- Design concepts
- Visual language
- Data structures
- Integration contracts

The project lead connects all modules into one unified prototype.

---

# 🧹 TEAM 1 — DATA SANITIZATION & FILE SANITIZATION

## 📌 Purpose

Team 1 is responsible for securely removing data and implementing the sanitization layer of the prototype.

The sanitization module is capable of handling:

- Individual files
- Folders
- Controlled disk images

It also classifies the target storage medium and recommends an appropriate sanitization approach.

---

# 🧩 Team 1 Modules

## 1. File Sanitization

Responsible for sanitizing individual files.

### Features

- File sanitization/deletion
- Target identification
- SHA-256 hash capture before sanitization
- Sanitization method selection
- Sanitization status
- Timestamp recording
- Explicit confirmation before destructive operation

---

## 2. Folder Sanitization

Responsible for sanitizing folders and their contents.

### Features

- Folder selection
- File enumeration
- File sanitization
- Folder-level result reporting
- Target information
- Timestamp
- Sanitization status

---

## 3. Controlled Disk-Image Sanitization

Responsible for demonstrating sanitization against controlled forensic disk images.

The MVP should use test disk images rather than automatically sanitizing physical devices.

Example:

```text
Controlled Disk Image
        │
        ▼
Target Identification
        │
        ▼
SHA-256 Capture
        │
        ▼
Sanitization Method
        │
        ▼
Sanitization
        │
        ▼
Result
```

---

## 4. Storage Media Classification

The system identifies the target medium as:

- HDD
- SSD/NVMe
- USB/Flash
- Disk Image
- Unknown

The classifier is used to recommend an appropriate sanitization approach.

---

## 5. Sanitization Method Recommendation

The system provides a sanitization recommendation based on the target medium.

```text
                 Target
                    │
                    ▼
            Media Classification
                    │
          ┌─────────┼─────────┐
          │         │         │
          ▼         ▼         ▼
         HDD       SSD      USB/Flash
          │         │         │
          └─────────┼─────────┘
                    │
                    ▼
          Recommended Method
```

The MVP primarily demonstrates classification and recommendation for physical media rather than automatically wiping real physical devices.

---

## 6. Sanitization Safety Layer

Destructive operations must include safety controls.

### Safety requirements

- Explicit user confirmation
- Display target path
- Display SHA-256 before sanitization
- Prevent accidental system-disk targeting
- Controlled test-image operation by default

---

# 🔎 TEAM 2 — FILE RECOVERY

## 📌 Purpose

Team 2 is responsible for finding, reconstructing, recovering, and validating deleted or otherwise recoverable files.

The recovery module combines:

- Sleuth Kit filesystem analysis
- Filesystem metadata analysis
- Deleted-file identification
- Filesystem-based recovery
- Raw file carving
- Fragmented-file reconstruction
- Recovery validation

---

# 🧩 Team 2 Modules

## 1. Disk Image Analysis

Analyzes the provided forensic disk image.

Responsibilities include:

- Identifying partitions
- Identifying filesystems
- Extracting filesystem information
- Locating relevant evidence

---

## 2. Sleuth Kit Integration

The project uses **The Sleuth Kit (TSK)** for filesystem-level forensic analysis.

Important tools include:

```text
mmls
fsstat
fls
istat
```

General workflow:

```text
Disk Image
    │
    ▼
   mmls
    │
    ▼
Partition Information
    │
    ▼
  fsstat
    │
    ▼
Filesystem Information
    │
    ▼
   fls
    │
    ▼
Deleted File Identification
    │
    ▼
Metadata / Inode Analysis
    │
    ▼
Recovery
```

---

# 3. Deleted File Identification

The system identifies files that are marked as deleted but whose data may still exist in the disk image.

Information may include:

- Filename
- Inode
- File size
- Location
- Allocation status
- Deleted status
- Filesystem evidence

---

# 4. Filesystem-Based File Recovery

Deleted files identified through filesystem metadata can be recovered using Sleuth Kit-based methods.

```text
Deleted File
     │
     ▼
Filesystem Metadata
     │
     ▼
Locate Data Blocks
     │
     ▼
Extract Data
     │
     ▼
Recovered Artifact
```

---

# 5. Raw File Carving

Raw file carving operates directly on the disk-image bytes.

This approach is useful when filesystem metadata is:

- Missing
- Damaged
- Unavailable
- Insufficient

The carving engine searches for file signatures and extracts file data based on file structure.

---

# 📂 Initial File-Carving Formats

The initial MVP targets:

| File Type | Extension |
|-----------|-----------|
| JPEG | `.jpg`, `.jpeg` |
| PNG | `.png` |
| PDF | `.pdf` |
| Microsoft Word | `.docx` |
| ZIP | `.zip` |

---

# 🧩 Raw File Carving Pipeline

```text
Disk Image
    │
    ▼
Read Raw Bytes
    │
    ▼
Search File Signatures
    │
    ▼
Identify File Header
    │
    ▼
Determine File Structure
    │
    ▼
Locate Appropriate End Marker
    │
    ▼
Extract File
    │
    ▼
Validate File
    │
    ▼
Generate Metadata
```

---

# 6. Fragmented File Reconstruction

A file may be stored in multiple non-contiguous locations on a disk.

Example:

```text
[FILE HEADER]
[FILE DATA]
[RANDOM DATA]
[RANDOM DATA]
[FILE DATA]
[FILE DATA]
[FILE END]
```

The system attempts to reconstruct fragmented files where sufficient structural information is available.

Possible evidence:

- File signatures
- File structure
- Filesystem metadata
- Block/cluster information
- Structural markers
- Validation results

---

# 7. Recovered File Validation

A recovered file is not automatically considered valid just because bytes were extracted.

The validation layer checks whether the recovered data represents a usable file.

Possible checks include:

- File signature verification
- Structural validation
- Parser validation
- Successful decoding
- Successful opening
- File size verification
- SHA-256 calculation
- Integrity status

```text
Recovered Artifact
       │
       ▼
Signature Check
       │
       ▼
Structure Check
       │
       ▼
Parser Validation
       │
       ▼
Integrity Check
       │
       ▼
VALID / PARTIAL / INVALID
```

---

# 8. Recovery Metadata

Each recovered artifact should contain metadata such as:

```json
{
    "file_name": "recovered_001.jpg",
    "file_type": "JPEG",
    "source_image": "carving.img",
    "offset": 1048576,
    "size": 245760,
    "recovery_method": "raw_carving",
    "validation_status": "VALID",
    "sha256": "..."
}
```

This metadata becomes evidence for Team 3.

---

# 🧠 TEAM 3 — ALGORITHM / FORENSIC INTELLIGENCE & VERIFICATION

## 📌 Purpose

Team 3 converts recovery and sanitization results into measurable and explainable forensic evidence.

Team 3 is responsible for:

- Recovery confidence
- Recoverability scoring
- Baseline creation
- Before/after comparison
- Sanitization verification
- Audit trail
- Reporting
- Certificate generation

---

# 🧩 Team 3 Modules

## 1. Explainable Recovery Confidence

The system produces a recovery confidence score supported by understandable evidence.

Possible evidence includes:

- Valid file signature
- Structural checks
- Parser validation
- Filesystem evidence
- Successful file decoding
- Integrity checks

The goal is not just:

```text
FILE FOUND
```

but:

```text
FILE FOUND
     │
     ├── Valid Signature
     ├── Valid Structure
     ├── Parser Passed
     ├── Filesystem Evidence
     └── Integrity Passed
              │
              ▼
       RECOVERY CONFIDENCE
```

---

# 2. Recoverability Score

The project defines a **Recoverability Score**.

This score summarizes how recoverable an artifact is rather than simply reporting that the file was found.

Example conceptual model:

```text
Filesystem Evidence
        +
Signature Validity
        +
Structural Validity
        +
Parser Validation
        +
Integrity
        │
        ▼
Recoverability Score
```

The exact scoring algorithm is project-defined.

---

# 3. Pre-Sanitization Recovery Baseline

Before sanitization, the system performs recovery and records the identified artifacts.

Example:

```text
                  BEFORE SANITIZATION
                           │
                           ▼
                    Analyze Image
                           │
                           ▼
                    Recover Files
                           │
                           ▼
                     Validate Files
                           │
                           ▼
                   Calculate Scores
                           │
                           ▼
                  CREATE BASELINE
```

The baseline records what was recoverable before sanitization.

---

# 4. Post-Sanitization Recovery

After Team 1 sanitizes the target, Team 2 performs recovery again.

```text
Baseline
   │
   ▼
Sanitization
   │
   ▼
Post-Sanitization Image
   │
   ▼
Recovery
   │
   ▼
Validation
   │
   ▼
Post-Sanitization Results
```

---

# 5. Before/After Comparison

Team 3 compares:

```text
BEFORE SANITIZATION
        │
        ▼
Recovered Artifacts
        │
        ▼
Recovery Baseline
        │
        │
        ▼
SANITIZATION
        │
        ▼
AFTER SANITIZATION
        │
        ▼
Recovered Artifacts
        │
        ▼
Comparison
```

The system determines whether previously identified artifacts remain recoverable.

---

# 6. Sanitization Verification

The system verifies the sanitization outcome based on the defined recovery procedure.

The verification statement is:

> **"No previously identified artifacts were recovered under the defined verification procedure."**

The system can produce:

```text
BEFORE
   │
   ├── Artifact A
   ├── Artifact B
   └── Artifact C
        │
        ▼
   SANITIZATION
        │
        ▼
AFTER
   │
   ├── Artifact A ❌
   ├── Artifact B ❌
   └── Artifact C ❌
        │
        ▼
     VERIFICATION
        │
        ▼
       PASS
```

If previously identified artifacts remain recoverable, the verification result can be marked as **FAIL**.

---

# 7. Tamper-Evident Audit Trail

The system maintains a hash-chained audit trail.

Example:

```text
Event 1
   │
   ▼
Hash 1
   │
   ▼
Event 2 + Hash 1
   │
   ▼
Hash 2
   │
   ▼
Event 3 + Hash 2
   │
   ▼
Hash 3
```

If an earlier recorded event is modified, the hash chain becomes inconsistent.

This provides an integrity mechanism for the recorded workflow.

> This is a tamper-evident audit mechanism and **not blockchain**.

---

# 8. Automated Forensic Report

The system generates a consolidated report containing:

- Target information
- Recovery findings
- Recovery metadata
- Recovery confidence
- Recoverability score
- Sanitization details
- Before/after results
- Verification outcome
- Audit integrity
- Final status

---

# 9. Sanitization Certificate

The system can generate a sanitization certificate/report containing the final verification outcome.

Example:

```text
==================================================
          SANITIZATION CERTIFICATE
==================================================

Target              : carving.img

Pre-Sanitization
Artifacts Recovered : 5

Sanitization Status : COMPLETED

Post-Sanitization
Artifacts Recovered : 0

Verification        : PASS

Audit Integrity     : VALID

Statement:
No previously identified artifacts were recovered
under the defined verification procedure.

==================================================
```

---

# 🧪 TESTING STRATEGY

The MVP should primarily use controlled test disk images.

## Test Scenario 1 — Deleted File Recovery

```text
Create File
     │
     ▼
Store File
     │
     ▼
Delete File
     │
     ▼
Create Disk Image
     │
     ▼
Analyze Image
     │
     ▼

# Test Scenario 2 — Raw File Carving

```text
Create Test File
     │
     ▼
Place Data in Disk Image
     │
     ▼
Remove Filesystem Reference
     │
     ▼

     │
     ▼
Detect Signature
     │
     ▼
Carve
     │
     ▼

```

---

# Test Scenario 4 — Multiple File Formats

The test image can contain:

```text
carving.img
│
├── image.jpg
├── image.png
├── document.pdf
├── document.docx
└── archive.zip
```

The recovery engine attempts to identify and recover each supported artifact.

# 🔐 SECURITY & SAFETY BOUNDARY

The MVP should operate on **controlled test disk images by default**.

## Mandatory Safety Rules

- Never automatically target system disks.
- Never automatically target `/dev/sda`.
- Never automatically target `/dev/nvme*`.
- Destructive operations require explicit confirmation.
- Display the target path before sanitization.
- Display the SHA-256 hash before sanitization.
- Use controlled test images for destructive demonstrations.
- Do not perform destructive operations on real user data.

---

# ⚠️ SSD / NVMe Limitation

The prototype should not claim universal or permanent deletion, particularly for:

- SSD
- NVMe
- Flash-based storage

For physical storage types, the MVP should primarily demonstrate:

```text
MEDIA CLASSIFICATION
        +
METHOD RECOMMENDATION
```

rather than automatically wiping real physical devices.

---

# 🧠 AI/ML Scope

AI/ML is intentionally **not included in the working MVP** due to the short development window.

It can be presented as a future enhancement.

Potential future applications include:

- Intelligent artifact classification
- Advanced recovery prioritization
- Fragmented-file prediction
- Automated evidence classification
- Anomaly detection
- Recovery success prediction

---

# ⭐ PROJECT UNIQUE SELLING POINTS

## 1. Primary USP

> **Don't just erase data. Prove what was recoverable before sanitization — and prove what remains afterward.**

---

## 2. Explainable Recovery Confidence

Recovery confidence is supported by understandable forensic evidence such as:

- Valid file signatures
- Structural checks
- Parser validation
- Filesystem evidence

---

## 3. Recoverability Score

A project-defined metric that describes how recoverable an artifact is rather than simply reporting that a file was found.

---

## 4. Before/After Verification

The system establishes a recovery baseline before sanitization and compares it with post-sanitization recovery results.

---

## 5. Tamper-Evident Audit Trail

Hash-chained audit events make changes to recorded workflow information detectable.

This is an audit-integrity mechanism and **not blockchain**.

---

## 6. Automated Reporting & Certificate

The system generates a consolidated result containing:

- Target information
- Sanitization details
- Recovery findings
- Verification outcome
- Audit integrity
- Certificate/report

---

                     ▼
          GENERATE REPORT/CERTIFICATE
```

The goal is not merely to erase data or recover files independently.

The goal is to provide an **evidence-driven, measurable, and verifiable workflow for data sanitization and forensic file recovery**.

# 🔐 Integrated Secure Data Erasure & Advanced File Recovery Tool

## SIH 2026 — Digital Forensics & Data Sanitization

An integrated digital forensics prototype designed to securely sanitize data, recover deleted files, verify sanitization effectiveness, measure recovery quality, maintain a tamper-evident audit trail, and generate a consolidated forensic report.

---

# 📌 Problem Statement

### Design and Development of an Integrated Secure Data Erasure and Advanced File Recovery Tool for Digital Forensics and Data Sanitization.

The objective of this project is to build a unified platform that combines:

- Secure data sanitization
- File and folder deletion
- Disk-image sanitization
- Filesystem analysis
- Deleted-file recovery
- Raw file carving
- Fragmented-file reconstruction
- Recovery validation
- Recovery confidence scoring
- Recoverability scoring
- Before/after sanitization comparison
- Sanitization verification
- Tamper-evident audit logging
- Automated forensic reporting
- Sanitization certificate generation

The prototype is designed as a focused **2–3 day MVP** using controlled test disk images.

---

# 🎯 Core Project Objective

The main idea of the project is:

> **Don't just erase data. Prove what was recoverable before sanitization — and prove what remains afterward.**

Instead of simply performing data deletion, the system creates a closed forensic loop:

```text
RECOVER
   ↓
MEASURE
   ↓
BASELINE
   ↓
SANITIZE
   ↓
RECOVER AGAIN
   ↓
COMPARE
   ↓
VERIFY
   ↓
REPORT
```

This makes the system capable of demonstrating the effectiveness of sanitization using measurable recovery evidence.

# 👥 Team Structure

The project is divided into three major teams:

| Team | Module | Primary Responsibility |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Team 1 | Data Sanitization & File Sanitization | Securely remove data |
| Team 2 | File Recovery | Find, recover, reconstruct and validate files |
| Team 3 | Algorithm / Forensic Intelligence & Verification | Score, compare, verify, audit and report |

Each team develops its own module while following common:

- Design concepts
- Visual language
- Data structures
- Integration contracts

The project lead connects all modules into one unified prototype.

---

# 🧹 TEAM 1 — DATA SANITIZATION & FILE SANITIZATION

## 📌 Purpose

Team 1 is responsible for securely removing data and implementing the sanitization layer of the prototype.

The sanitization module is capable of handling:

- Individual files
- Folders
- Controlled disk images

It also classifies the target storage medium and recommends an appropriate sanitization approach.

---

# 🧩 Team 1 Modules

## 1. File Sanitization

Responsible for sanitizing individual files.

### Features

- File sanitization/deletion
- Target identification
- SHA-256 hash capture before sanitization
- Sanitization method selection
- Sanitization status
- Timestamp recording
- Explicit confirmation before destructive operation

---

## 2. Folder Sanitization

Responsible for sanitizing folders and their contents.

### Features

- Folder selection
- File enumeration
- File sanitization
- Folder-level result reporting
- Target information
- Timestamp
- Sanitization status

---

## 3. Controlled Disk-Image Sanitization

Responsible for demonstrating sanitization against controlled forensic disk images.

The MVP should use test disk images rather than automatically sanitizing physical devices.

Example:

```text
Controlled Disk Image
        │
        ▼
Target Identification
        │
        ▼
SHA-256 Capture
        │
        ▼
Sanitization Method
        │
        ▼
Sanitization
        │
        ▼
Result
```

---

## 4. Storage Media Classification

The system identifies the target medium as:

- HDD
- SSD/NVMe
- USB/Flash
- Disk Image
- Unknown

The classifier is used to recommend an appropriate sanitization approach.

---

## 5. Sanitization Method Recommendation

The system provides a sanitization recommendation based on the target medium.

```text
                 Target
                    │
                    ▼
            Media Classification
                    │
          ┌─────────┼─────────┐
          │         │         │
          ▼         ▼         ▼
         HDD       SSD      USB/Flash
          │         │         │
          └─────────┼─────────┘
                    │
                    ▼
          Recommended Method
```

The MVP primarily demonstrates classification and recommendation for physical media rather than automatically wiping real physical devices.

---

## 6. Sanitization Safety Layer

Destructive operations must include safety controls.

### Safety requirements

- Explicit user confirmation
- Display target path
- Display SHA-256 before sanitization
- Prevent accidental system-disk targeting
- Controlled test-image operation by default

---

# 🔎 TEAM 2 — FILE RECOVERY

## 📌 Purpose

Team 2 is responsible for finding, reconstructing, recovering, and validating deleted or otherwise recoverable files.

The recovery module combines:

- Sleuth Kit filesystem analysis
- Filesystem metadata analysis
- Deleted-file identification
- Filesystem-based recovery
- Raw file carving
- Fragmented-file reconstruction
- Recovery validation

---

# 🧩 Team 2 Modules

## 1. Disk Image Analysis

Analyzes the provided forensic disk image.

Responsibilities include:

- Identifying partitions
- Identifying filesystems
- Extracting filesystem information
- Locating relevant evidence

---

## 2. Sleuth Kit Integration

The project uses **The Sleuth Kit (TSK)** for filesystem-level forensic analysis.

Important tools include:

```text
mmls
fsstat
fls
istat
```

General workflow:

```text
Disk Image
    │
    ▼
   mmls
    │
    ▼
Partition Information
    │
    ▼
  fsstat
    │
    ▼
Filesystem Information
    │
    ▼
   fls
    │
    ▼
Deleted File Identification
    │
    ▼
Metadata / Inode Analysis
    │
    ▼
Recovery
```

---

# 3. Deleted File Identification

The system identifies files that are marked as deleted but whose data may still exist in the disk image.

Information may include:

- Filename
- Inode
- File size
- Location
- Allocation status
- Deleted status
- Filesystem evidence

---

# 4. Filesystem-Based File Recovery

Deleted files identified through filesystem metadata can be recovered using Sleuth Kit-based methods.

```text
Deleted File
     │
     ▼
Filesystem Metadata
     │
     ▼
Locate Data Blocks
     │
     ▼
Extract Data
     │
     ▼
Recovered Artifact
```

---

# 5. Raw File Carving

Raw file carving operates directly on the disk-image bytes.

This approach is useful when filesystem metadata is:

- Missing
- Damaged
- Unavailable
- Insufficient

The carving engine searches for file signatures and extracts file data based on file structure.

---

# 📂 Initial File-Carving Formats

The initial MVP targets:

| File Type | Extension |
|-----------|-----------|
| JPEG | `.jpg`, `.jpeg` |
| PNG | `.png` |
| PDF | `.pdf` |
| Microsoft Word | `.docx` |
| ZIP | `.zip` |

---

# 🧩 Raw File Carving Pipeline

```text
Disk Image
    │
    ▼
Read Raw Bytes
    │
    ▼
Search File Signatures
    │
    ▼
Identify File Header
    │
    ▼
Determine File Structure
    │
    ▼
Locate Appropriate End Marker
    │
    ▼
Extract File
    │
    ▼
Validate File
    │
    ▼
Generate Metadata
```

---

# 6. Fragmented File Reconstruction

A file may be stored in multiple non-contiguous locations on a disk.

Example:

```text
[FILE HEADER]
[FILE DATA]
[RANDOM DATA]
[RANDOM DATA]
[FILE DATA]
[FILE DATA]
[FILE END]
```

The system attempts to reconstruct fragmented files where sufficient structural information is available.

Possible evidence:

- File signatures
- File structure
- Filesystem metadata
- Block/cluster information
- Structural markers
- Validation results

---

# 7. Recovered File Validation

A recovered file is not automatically considered valid just because bytes were extracted.

The validation layer checks whether the recovered data represents a usable file.

Possible checks include:

- File signature verification
- Structural validation
- Parser validation
- Successful decoding
- Successful opening
- File size verification
- SHA-256 calculation
- Integrity status

```text
Recovered Artifact
       │
       ▼
Signature Check
       │
       ▼
Structure Check
       │
       ▼
Parser Validation
       │
       ▼
Integrity Check
       │
       ▼
VALID / PARTIAL / INVALID
```

---

# 8. Recovery Metadata

Each recovered artifact should contain metadata such as:

```json
{
    "file_name": "recovered_001.jpg",
    "file_type": "JPEG",
    "source_image": "carving.img",
    "offset": 1048576,
    "size": 245760,
    "recovery_method": "raw_carving",
    "validation_status": "VALID",
    "sha256": "..."
}
```

This metadata becomes evidence for Team 3.

---

# 🧠 TEAM 3 — ALGORITHM / FORENSIC INTELLIGENCE & VERIFICATION

## 📌 Purpose

Team 3 converts recovery and sanitization results into measurable and explainable forensic evidence.

Team 3 is responsible for:

- Recovery confidence
- Recoverability scoring
- Baseline creation
- Before/after comparison
- Sanitization verification
- Audit trail
- Reporting
- Certificate generation

---

# 🧩 Team 3 Modules

## 1. Explainable Recovery Confidence

The system produces a recovery confidence score supported by understandable evidence.

Possible evidence includes:

- Valid file signature
- Structural checks
- Parser validation
- Filesystem evidence
- Successful file decoding
- Integrity checks

The goal is not just:

```text
FILE FOUND
```

but:

```text
FILE FOUND
     │
     ├── Valid Signature
     ├── Valid Structure
     ├── Parser Passed
     ├── Filesystem Evidence
     └── Integrity Passed
              │
              ▼
       RECOVERY CONFIDENCE
```

---

# 2. Recoverability Score

The project defines a **Recoverability Score**.

This score summarizes how recoverable an artifact is rather than simply reporting that the file was found.

Example conceptual model:

```text
Filesystem Evidence
        +
Signature Validity
        +
Structural Validity
        +
Parser Validation
        +
Integrity
        │
        ▼
Recoverability Score
```

The exact scoring algorithm is project-defined.

---

# 3. Pre-Sanitization Recovery Baseline

Before sanitization, the system performs recovery and records the identified artifacts.

Example:

```text
                  BEFORE SANITIZATION
                           │
                           ▼
                    Analyze Image
                           │
                           ▼
                    Recover Files
                           │
                           ▼
                     Validate Files
                           │
                           ▼
                   Calculate Scores
                           │
                           ▼
                  CREATE BASELINE
```

The baseline records what was recoverable before sanitization.

---

# 4. Post-Sanitization Recovery

After Team 1 sanitizes the target, Team 2 performs recovery again.

```text
Baseline
   │
   ▼
Sanitization
   │
   ▼
Post-Sanitization Image
   │
   ▼
Recovery
   │
   ▼
Validation
   │
   ▼
Post-Sanitization Results
```

---

# 5. Before/After Comparison

Team 3 compares:

```text
BEFORE SANITIZATION
        │
        ▼
Recovered Artifacts
        │
        ▼
Recovery Baseline
        │
        │
        ▼
SANITIZATION
        │
        ▼
AFTER SANITIZATION
        │
        ▼
Recovered Artifacts
        │
        ▼
Comparison
```

The system determines whether previously identified artifacts remain recoverable.

---

# 6. Sanitization Verification

The system verifies the sanitization outcome based on the defined recovery procedure.

The verification statement is:

> **"No previously identified artifacts were recovered under the defined verification procedure."**

The system can produce:

```text
BEFORE
   │
   ├── Artifact A
   ├── Artifact B
   └── Artifact C
        │
        ▼
   SANITIZATION
        │
        ▼
AFTER
   │
   ├── Artifact A ❌
   ├── Artifact B ❌
   └── Artifact C ❌
        │
        ▼
     VERIFICATION
        │
        ▼
       PASS
```

If previously identified artifacts remain recoverable, the verification result can be marked as **FAIL**.

---

# 7. Tamper-Evident Audit Trail

The system maintains a hash-chained audit trail.

Example:

```text
Event 1
   │
   ▼
Hash 1
   │
   ▼
Event 2 + Hash 1
   │
   ▼
Hash 2
   │
   ▼
Event 3 + Hash 2
   │
   ▼
Hash 3
```

If an earlier recorded event is modified, the hash chain becomes inconsistent.

This provides an integrity mechanism for the recorded workflow.

> This is a tamper-evident audit mechanism and **not blockchain**.

---

# 8. Automated Forensic Report

The system generates a consolidated report containing:

- Target information
- Recovery findings
- Recovery metadata
- Recovery confidence
- Recoverability score
- Sanitization details
- Before/after results
- Verification outcome
- Audit integrity
- Final status

---

# 9. Sanitization Certificate

The system can generate a sanitization certificate/report containing the final verification outcome.

Example:

```text
==================================================
          SANITIZATION CERTIFICATE
==================================================

Target              : carving.img

Pre-Sanitization
Artifacts Recovered : 5

Sanitization Status : COMPLETED

Post-Sanitization
Artifacts Recovered : 0

Verification        : PASS

Audit Integrity     : VALID

Statement:
No previously identified artifacts were recovered
under the defined verification procedure.

==================================================
```

---

# 🔄 COMPLETE SYSTEM WORKFLOW

     │
     ▼
Detect Signature
     │
     ▼
Carve
     │
     ▼

# Test Scenario 4 — Multiple File Formats

The test image can contain:

```text
carving.img
│
├── image.jpg
├── image.png
├── document.pdf
├── document.docx
└── archive.zip
```

The recovery engine attempts to identify and recover each supported artifact.

# 🔐 SECURITY & SAFETY BOUNDARY

The MVP should operate on **controlled test disk images by default**.

## Mandatory Safety Rules

- Never automatically target system disks.
- Never automatically target `/dev/sda`.
- Never automatically target `/dev/nvme*`.
- Destructive operations require explicit confirmation.
- Display the target path before sanitization.
- Display the SHA-256 hash before sanitization.
- Use controlled test images for destructive demonstrations.
- Do not perform destructive operations on real user data.

---

# ⚠️ SSD / NVMe Limitation

The prototype should not claim universal or permanent deletion, particularly for:

- SSD
- NVMe
- Flash-based storage

For physical storage types, the MVP should primarily demonstrate:

```text
MEDIA CLASSIFICATION
        +
METHOD RECOMMENDATION
```

rather than automatically wiping real physical devices.

---

# 🧠 AI/ML Scope

AI/ML is intentionally **not included in the working MVP** due to the short development window.

It can be presented as a future enhancement.

Potential future applications include:

- Intelligent artifact classification
- Advanced recovery prioritization
- Fragmented-file prediction
- Automated evidence classification
- Anomaly detection
- Recovery success prediction

---

# ⭐ PROJECT UNIQUE SELLING POINTS

## 1. Primary USP

> **Don't just erase data. Prove what was recoverable before sanitization — and prove what remains afterward.**

---

## 2. Explainable Recovery Confidence

Recovery confidence is supported by understandable forensic evidence such as:

- Valid file signatures
- Structural checks
- Parser validation
- Filesystem evidence

---

## 3. Recoverability Score

A project-defined metric that describes how recoverable an artifact is rather than simply reporting that a file was found.

---

## 4. Before/After Verification

The system establishes a recovery baseline before sanitization and compares it with post-sanitization recovery results.

---

## 5. Tamper-Evident Audit Trail

Hash-chained audit events make changes to recorded workflow information detectable.

This is an audit-integrity mechanism and **not blockchain**.

---

## 6. Automated Reporting & Certificate

The system generates a consolidated result containing:

- Target information
- Sanitization details
- Recovery findings
- Verification outcome
- Audit integrity
- Certificate/report

---

                     ▼
             MEASURE RECOVERY
                     │
                     ▼
             RECORD BASELINE
                     │
                     ▼
              SANITIZE DATA
                     │
                     ▼
            ATTEMPT RECOVERY
                     │
                     ▼
             COMPARE RESULTS
                     │
                     ▼
              VERIFY RESULT
                     │
                     ▼
            PROVE THE OUTCOME
                     │
                     ▼
          GENERATE REPORT/CERTIFICATE
```

The goal is not merely to erase data or recover files independently.

The goal is to provide an **evidence-driven, measurable, and verifiable workflow for data sanitization and forensic file recovery**.
